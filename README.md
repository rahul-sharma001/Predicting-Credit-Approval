# Predicting-Credit-Approval
Developed an automated system for predicting credit card approvals using a Logistic Regression model. Through the utilization of Grid Search to fine-tune the model's parameters, I achieved a classification accuracy of 85%, as evidenced by the Confusion Matrix. The key preprocessing procedures encompassed Scaling, Label Encoding, and Addressing Missing Values.
